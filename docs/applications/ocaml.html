<h1>OCaml</h1>

<p>
OCaml is a strict functional language.

<h2>Functional and Strict</h2>
<p>
Let me say very quickly why we call it functional and why we call it strict.
We call it functional because it has lambda calculus at its core.
Lambda calculus terms are defined as follows:
$$\begin{array}{rcll}
t &amp; ::= &amp; x  &amp; \text{variable} \\
&amp; \mid &amp; t\,t &amp; \text{application} \\
&amp; \mid &amp; \lambda x.\, t &amp; \text{abstraction}
\end{array}$$
In words:
  if $x$ is a variable, then $x$ is a term;
  if $t_1$ and $t_2$ are terms, then $t_1\,t_2$ is a term (and we say that $t_1$ is applied to $t_2$);
  if $x$ is a variable and $t$ is a term, then $\lambda x.\,t$ is a term.
Here are some examples of terms:
$$
x \qquad x\,x \qquad (\lambda x.\, (x x))\,(\lambda x.\, (x\, x))
$$

<p>
Apart from existing, these terms also <i>do</i> something.
More precisely, we define the $\beta$-reduction rule as follows:
$$
  (\lambda x.\, t_1) t_2 \;\triangleright_\beta\; t_1[x\mapsto t_2]
$$
This notation means that inside $t_1$ we replace $x$ by $t_2$.

<p>
OCaml is called functional because it can do all these things, and more.
Instead of $(\lambda x.\, t)$, in OCaml we write <code class="prettyprint lang-ml">(fun x -&gt; t)</code>.
Here is an example of $\beta$-reduction with OCaml code:

<p>
<code class="prettyprint lang-ml">((fun f -&gt; fun x -&gt; f (f x)) (fun x -&gt; x + 1)) 10</code>
<br/>$\triangleright_\beta$
<code class="prettyprint lang-ml">(fun x -&gt; (fun x -&gt; x + 1) ((fun x -&gt; x + 1) x)) 10</code>
<br/>$\approx_\alpha$
<code class="prettyprint lang-ml">(fun x -&gt; (fun y -&gt; y + 1) ((fun z -&gt; z + 1) x)) 10</code>
<br/>$\triangleright_\beta$
<code class="prettyprint lang-ml">(fun x -&gt; (fun y -&gt; y + 1) (x + 1)) 10</code>
<br/>$\triangleright_\beta$
<code class="prettyprint lang-ml">(fun x -&gt; (x + 1) + 1) 10</code>
<br/>$\triangleright_\beta$
<code class="prettyprint lang-ml">(10 + 1) + 1</code>
</p>

<p>
There are quite a few things to observe here:
<ul>
<li>The <code>fun</code> construct introduces a variable name, and occurrences of variables names refer to the innermost such <code>fun</code> that matches.
  The $\approx_\alpha$ step is called $\alpha$-renaming.
  In that step we changed distinct variables to have distinct names, so we don't get confused.
<li>We can apply $\beta$-reduction to a term inside a term.
  In particular, in some situations there are a few places where we could apply $\beta$-reduction.
  OCaml is called <i>strict</i> because it always chooses a small (that is, innermost) term to reduce.
<li>OCaml has integers, which are not present in lambda calculus.
  Indeed, it is quite difficult to give nice examples without using some add-ons, such as integers or strings.
</ul>

<p>
Two other big add-ons of OCaml, as compared to $\lambda$-calculus, are (1)&nbsp;the ability to name things, and (2)&nbsp;types.
Indeed, the term from above would more likely be written as follows:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ml">
let twice f x = f (f x) in
let addone x = x + 1 in
twice addone 10
</pre>

<p>
To see how this becomes what we wrote earlier, we desugar step by step.
First, we make the $\lambda$-abstractions explicit.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ml">
let twice = (fun f -&gt; (fun x -&gt; f (f x))) in
let addone = (fun x -&gt; x + 1) in
twice addone 10
</pre>

<p>
Then we replace names by the expressions they denote.

<p>
The types of some of the terms from above are

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ml">
val twice : ('a -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'a
val addone : int -&gt; int
val 10 : int
val (+) : int -&gt; int -&gt; int
</pre>

<h2>Now, Slightly Slower</h2>

<p>
What follows is a tutorial based on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages">lecture notes of Dan Grossman</a>.
Here, however, we'll go quicker.
If you want the slower pace, follow the link above.
