<h1>Count Distinct</h1>

<p>
You want to count how many distinct visitors your website has next year.
Of course, you expect your website to be extremely popular.
You're thinking you'll have, say, 1000 visitors every second, so you're expecting billions of visitors per year.
If you'd be storing the IP address of each visit, you'd need gigabytes, or tens of gigabytes of space.
Is it possible to <i>approximate</i> the number of unique visitors by using <i>much less</i> space?
