<h1>Pagerank</h1>

<p>
The pagerank of a webpage is defined to be the limit of the following process.
Suppose each webpage start with a unit of credit.
At each time unit, each webpage sends all its credit along its outgoing links, equally divided.
After many simulation steps, we will reach a fixed-point: a webpage gives all its credit, but receives back on its incoming links exactly how much it gave.

<p>
To be able to do this, we assume that each webpage has at least one outgoing link.
That's not true in practice.
We fix this problem as follows.
We add a dummy webpage, and give it one outgoing link to each non-dummy webpage.
Now, at each simulation step, each webpage (including the dummy one) with at least one outgoing link does the following:

<ul>
<li>send a fraction $\alpha$ of its credit to the dummy webpage, and
<li>split the rest equally among its outgoing links.
</ul>

<p>
And each webpage with no outgoing link sends all its credit to the dummy webpage.
We typically choose $\alpha \approx 0.15$.

<p>
A variation of this scheme, whose purpose is to avoid link-spammer's spider traps, is to add outgoing links from the dummy webpage not to all non-dummy webpages but only to a trusted subset.
This way, the credit that gets recirculated will enter back the network only at trusted points.
(Spider traps work by simply having <i>many</i> webpages that would act as entry points for the credit that gets recirculated.)

<h2>Input/Output</h2>

<p>
<b>Input:</b>
The first line contains an integer $n$ which gives the number of pages.
We will identify pages by numbers $1,\ldots,n$.
The second line contains a real number $\alpha$, which says what credit proportion is sent to the dummy page.
The next $n$ lines each contain a list of integers:
  on the $i$th line we have a list of pages to which page $i$ has links;
  this list is terminated by a dummy $0$.
It <i>is</i> possible to have multiple links to the same destination.

<p>
<b>Output:</b>
$n+1$ real numbers that add up to $n+1$.
The first is the pagerank of the dummy node; the following ones are the pageranks of pages $1,\ldots,n$.
